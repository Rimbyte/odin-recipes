# Odin Recipes

This is a simple HTML project created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## About

The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML. It will contain a main index page with links to a few recipe pages.

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated:

- Understanding of basic HTML structure and syntax
- Ability to create and link multiple HTML pages
- Familiarity with using Git and GitHub for version control
- Practice using the command line and SSH to clone repositories

## Future Enhancements

Once the HTML part is complete, I may return to add CSS styling and possibly JavaScript for interaction.
