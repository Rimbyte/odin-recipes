    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These seasoned baked chicken breasts always turn out tender, juicy, and perfect every time with this easy 5-ingredient recipe. Adding some chicken broth to the delicious pan drippings creates a flavorful sauce to serve with the chicken.</p>

        <li>Chicken Breasts</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Creole Seasoning</li>
        <li>Chicken Broth</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Coat the chicken breasts with olive oil, then sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning.</li>
        <li>Place the seasoned chicken breasts in a broiler pan. Bake in an oven for about 10 minutes, then flip and continue to bake for about 15 more minutes (or until the juices run clear). When the chicken is done baking, transfer it to a plate.</li>
